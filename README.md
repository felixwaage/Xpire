# Introduction

Xpire is a progressive web application (pwa) based on react.js. The goal is to reduce the waste of food by intelligently managing it locally in a database. For this purpose, the user can scan the products using the barcode and store an expiration date for them. Xpire then provides an overview of all stored products and proactively notifies the user of expiring food.
